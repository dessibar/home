<h1>Project Background</h1>
<p>Capelin is a short-lived, cold-water, forage fish species that occurs in numerous discrete populations throughout the circumpolar Arctic region. This project focuses on the North Atlantic populations in the Barents Sea, and around Iceland.</p> 
<p>The central role played by capelin in these ecosystems is well documented in the literature. For instance, the three Barents Sea stock collapses in 1985-1989, 1993-1997, and 2003-2006 had effects both downwards and upwards (e.g., higher cod cannibalism and natural mortality) in the food web. During the near collapse of the Icelandic capelin stock in the early 1980s and 1990s, the weight of cod (in particular among age groups 4â€“8) decreased by about 25-30%. The condition of the cod in both periods only improved when the capelin abundance increased. This indicates that, in Icelandic waters, cod cannot fully substitute for the loss of the capelin by reverting to other food sources. </p> 
<p>Given the short life span of capelin (4-5 years), fisheries are usually supported by only one or two year-classes, and a precautionary, integrated, and ecosystem-based approach to management of the fisheries is therefore necessary. Such a management approach is however, challenging and highly uncertain. This is partly because capelin abundance can be difficult to quantify, and the species exhibits large natural variations in abundance over space and time, and traditional single-species management using quotas has shortcomings when applied to capelin. Sustainable management of capelin is further challenged by the fact that the species is highly susceptible to population collapse when the effects of high fishing and unfavorable environmental conditions act in concert. These characteristics are common to both stocks; the Barents Sea capelin, and the Icelandic capelin.</p>  
<p>Since the Icelandic and Barents Sea capelin stocks share identical biological and ecological traits, some commonalities in stock monitoring, assessment and management is to be expected. This is background to the DESSIBAR project.</p>
